**Project Goal:** Create a **truly global, worldwide directory website** called "[Your Chosen Website Name]" for anyone, anywhere in the world, to easily search and discover authentic Gujarati, Punjabi, and South Indian restaurants. The platform must be designed for a global audience from the outset, allowing users from any country to find restaurants in any other country, state, or city. The site will also allow restaurant owners from anywhere in the world to list their businesses. Monetization will initially be through Google AdSense, with potential for premium restaurant listings later.

**Target Audiences:**
1.  Individuals **across the globe** looking for Gujarati, Punjabi, or South Indian restaurants in their local area or in places they plan to visit **worldwide**.
2.  Owners of Gujarati, Punjabi, or South Indian restaurants **anywhere in the world**.
